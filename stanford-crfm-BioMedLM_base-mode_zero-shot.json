In particular, it has been shown that it is possible to control the quantum state of a single photon^[@CR9]--[@CR12]^. However, the ability to control the quantum state of a large number of photons is still a challenge^[@CR13]--[@CR15]^.\n\nIn this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to control the quantum state of a large number of photons. Our approach is based on the concept of quantum steering^[@CR16]--[@CR18]^, which is the ability to steer the quantum state of a single photon from one location to another. In particular, we show that it is possible to steer the quantum state of a large number of photons from one input port of a beam splitter (BS) to another.\n\nThe concept of quantum steering is closely related to the concept of quantum entanglement^[@CR19],[@CR20]^.

The NOTCH3 gene is located on chromosome 19p13.1 and encodes a transmembrane receptor. NOTCH3 is expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, pericytes, and endothelial cells. NOTCH3 plays an important role in the development of vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes. NOTCH3 is also involved in the differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells into the contractile phenotype. Mutations in the NOTCH3 gene lead to a reduction in the number of vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes, as well as a reduction in the differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells into the contractile phenotype, resulting in the loss of vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes.

NOTCH3 is a single-pass transmembrane receptor expressed on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and pericytes. NOTCH3 is activated by binding to one of its ligands, Jagged1, Jagged2, or Delta-like 4. NOTCH3 is cleaved by the \u03b3-secretase complex, releasing the NOTCH3 intracellular domain (NICD3). NICD3 translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to the recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region (RBPJ) and activates the transcription of NOTCH target genes, such as HES1, HEY1, HEY2, and HEYL. HES1 and HEY1/2 are basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors that negatively regulate the expression of smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation markers, such as \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC). In addition, HES1 and HEY1/2 negatively regulate the expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\u03b2 (PDGFR-\u03b2), which is a receptor for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB. PDGF-BB is a potent mitogen for VSMCs and pericytes. Therefore, HES1 and HEY1/2 negatively regulate the proliferation and migration of VSMCs and pericytes. Thus, NOTCH3 signaling negatively regulates the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of VSMCs and pericytes. In addition, NOTCH3 signaling negatively regulates the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in VSMCs and pericytes. VEGF is a potent mitogen for VSMCs and pericytes. Therefore, NOTCH3 signaling negatively regulates the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of VSMCs and pericytes.

In CADASIL, NOTCH3 mutations result in the accumulation of NOTCH3 in VSMCs and the formation of granular osmiophilic material (GOM) in the extracellular matrix (ECM). GOM is thought to play a key role in the pathogenesis of CADASIL. However, the mechanisms by which NOTCH3 mutations lead to the accumulation of GOM in the ECM and the subsequent development of CADASIL are not fully understood. In this review, we discuss the roles of NOTCH3 and GOM in the pathogenesis of CADASIL, with a focus on the roles of NOTCH3 and GOM in VSMC proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. We also discuss the mechanisms by which NOTCH3 mutations lead to the accumulation of GOM in the ECM and the subsequent development of CADASIL.Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\nIn the last decade, the number of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) has been increasing worldwide \\[[@CR1], [@CR2]\\].
