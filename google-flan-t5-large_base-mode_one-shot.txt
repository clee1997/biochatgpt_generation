query: What is the therapeutic target for CADASIL? 
Answer the query: TMEM16A is a therapeutic target for CADASIL[1]. Ischemia in CADASIL activates TMEM16A, Ca2+ gated Cl- channel, which regulates pericyte tone and induces capillary constriction[2]. Potent inhibitors of TMEM16A, niclosamide has antiinflammtory effect[3]. Niclosamide can suppress enhance inflammation in CADASIL[4].[5]. 

evidence 0: CADASIL) is sometimes misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis (MS). MS and CADASIL are not known to co-occur and brain magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) findings can help with differential diagnosis. Despite the availability of this information, a case report is presented of a 61-year-old woman who was misdiagnosed with MS at age 50, tested positive for CADASIL at age 56, described incorrectly as having both conditions simultaneously, and continued on MS disease-modifying medications, resulting in financial and physical hardship.[1] 
evidence 1: Despite the availability of this information, a case report is presented of a 61-year-old woman who was misdiagnosed with MS at age 50, tested positive for CADASIL at age 56, described incorrectly as having both conditions simultaneously, and continued on MS disease-modifying medications, resulting in financial and physical hardship. Neuropsychological consultation helped initiate removal of the MS diagnosis and treatment. Better understanding is needed among clinicians that MS and CADASIL are not known to co-exist, that no association has been found between MS and the NOTCH3 mutations that cause CADASIL, and that neuroimaging and clinical features can help distinguish between the two conditions in addition to genetic testing.[2] 
evidence 2: Antithrombotic drugs were used in three patients, in one for an unrelated coexisting prothrombotic condition. CADASIL does not seem to be associated with an unfavorable outcome of pregnancy either for women and fetuses. Patients and treating physicians should be reassured that pregnancy can be safely initiated in CADASIL, as there is no evidence to support a specific preventive antithrombotic treatment during pregnancy in CADASIL.[3]

evidence 0: Using both wild type mice and transgenic mice carrying the human mutant Notch3 gene (CADASIL mice), we have recently characterized the pathological features of CADASIL and determined the therapeutic efficacy of two hematopoietic growth factors, stem cell factor (SCF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in CADASIL. Our findings have revealed novel pathological changes in the endothelium of cerebral capillaries and in the neural stem cells (NSCs). We have also observed the impairment of cognitive function in CADASIL mice.[1] 
evidence 1: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most common condition of hereditary stroke and vascular dementia. CADASIL is caused by Notch3 mutation, leading to progressive degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) of the small arteries in the brain. However, the pathogenesis of CADASIL remains largely unknown, and treatment that can stop or delay the progression of CADASIL is not yet available.[2] 
evidence 2: Today, CADASIL is known to every neurologist, but the disease has not yet revealed all its secrets. A lot of effort is still needed to understand the intimate mechanisms of the disease and the most efficient targets or approaches for the development of efficient therapeutics. The history of CADASIL will be further enriched by multiple ongoing research projects worldwide, at clinical and preclinical level, and will continue to enlighten research in the field of cerebral small vessel disorders.[3]

evidence 0: Syk inhibition was found to stabilize microtubules and potentiate paclitaxel activity in cellular models of taxane-resistant ovarian cancers. We further studied the effects of Syk inhibition on paclitaxel activity in Syk(+) ovarian cancer cell models and in variants selected for taxane resistance. Syk inhibition was accomplished using RNAi and by exposure to the small molecule competitive inhibitor R406, the active metabolite of fostamatinib.[1]

In this study, we studied the implication of SYK pathway in NASH, and investigated PLGA nanoparticles-based delivery of SYK pathway inhibitor as an effective and promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of NASH. We found positive correlation between SYK expression with the pathogenesis of NASH and alcoholic hepatitis in patients.[2]

evidence 0: Here we report the characterization of the human Notch3 gene which we mapped to the CADASIL critical region. We have identified mutations in CADASIL patients that cause serious disruption of this gene, indicating that Notch3 could be the defective protein in CADASIL patients.All these missense mutations may result in severe disruption of the Notch3 protein, as suggested by the highly conserved nature of the aminoacid residues involved, particularly the cysteines that are key features of EGF-like domains. These results indicate that these nucleotide substitutions are pathogenic mutations rather than rare polymorphisms.[1] 
evidence 1: Linkage studies in other families enabled further refinement of this genetic interval16,17 and identification of the mutated gene as NOTCH3 (Notch homolog 3).18[2] 
evidence 2: CADASIL, a hereditary vascular dementia, suggesting a role for Notch3 in vessel homeostasis (Joutel et al. 1996). CADASIL is a late-onset disorder, and neurological symptoms arise from a slowly developing systemic vasculopathy, characterized ultimately by degeneration of VSMC. ...maturation of VSMC, and ends around P28 when the artery acquires its final shape. We identify Notch3 to be the first key player of this process, by regulating cell-autonomously the arterial differentiation and maturation of VSMC.[3]

Answer: Notch3 is a human Notch3 gene that is located in the CADASIL critical region and may be the defective protein in CADASIL patients.

evidence 1: We believe that increased TGFb3 reflects an inflammatory condition and even an involvement of TGFb in fibrosis in CADASIL. Support for our hypothesis is the outcome of several studies that showed NOTCH3 and TGFb1 signalling play a key role in the pathogenesis and progression of chronic cardiovascular disease.[2]

In the present study, the activation of SYK was shown to increase the progression of peritoneal fibrosis through activation of the TGF-b1/Smad3 signaling pathway, and inhibition of TGF-b1 also resulted in down-regulation of SYK.[4] 
evidence 4: Our work confirms and highlights the relevance of NOTCH3 expression and signaling in pro-inflammatory macrophage activation and identified its prominent and specific role in the activation of NF-kB.
