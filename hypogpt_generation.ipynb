Potent inhibitors of TMEM16A, niclosamide has antiinflammtory effect. Niclosamide can suppress enhance inflammation in CADASIL. \\nevidence 0: Here we report the characterization of the human Notch3 gene which we mapped to the CADASIL critical region. We have identified mutations in CADASIL patients that cause serious disruption of this gene, indicating that Notch3 could be the defective protein in CADASIL patients.All these missense mutations may result in severe disruption of the Notch3 protein, as suggested by the highly conserved nature of the aminoacid residues involved, particularly the cysteines that are key features of EGF-like domains.

We further studied the effects of Syk inhibition on paclitaxel activity in Syk(+) ovarian cancer cell models and in variants selected for taxane resistance. Syk inhibition was accomplished using RNAi and by exposure to the small molecule competitive inhibitor R406, the active metabolite of fostamatinib. \\nevidence 1: Therefore, inhibition of the inflammatory macrophages would be a promising approach to attenuate NASH. In this study, we studied the implication of SYK pathway in NASH, and investigated PLGA nanoparticles-based delivery of SYK pathway inhibitor as an effective and promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of NASH. We found positive correlation between SYK expression with the pathogenesis of NASH and alcoholic hepatitis in patients. \\nevidence 2: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most common condition of hereditary stroke and vascular dementia. CADASIL is caused by Notch3 mutation, leading to progressive degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) of the small arteries in the brain.
