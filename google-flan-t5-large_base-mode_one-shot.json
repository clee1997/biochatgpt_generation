MS and CADASIL are not known to co-occur and brain magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) findings can help with differential diagnosis. Despite the availability of this information, a case report is presented of a 61-year-old woman who was misdiagnosed with MS at age 50, tested positive for CADASIL at age 56, described incorrectly as having both conditions simultaneously, and continued on MS disease-modifying medications, resulting in financial and physical hardship. \nevidence 1: Despite the availability of this information, a case report is presented of a 61-year-old woman who was misdiagnosed with MS at age 50, tested positive for CADASIL at age 56, described incorrectly as having both conditions simultaneously, and continued on MS disease-modifying medications, resulting in financial and physical hardship.
