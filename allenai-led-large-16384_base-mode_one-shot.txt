evidence 0: There is currently no consensus on whether CADASIL mutations generate hyperactive or hypoactive Notch3 proteins with regard to downstream signaling or whether CADASIL mutations are neutral in terms of Notch signaling. Whereas the R169C mutation appeared to lead to hyperactive Notch signaling (see above), the R1031C or C455R mutations were instead shown to be hypoactive,36[1] 
evidence 1: Our work confirms and highlights the relevance of NOTCH3 expression and signaling in pro-inflammatory macrophage activation and identified its prominent and specific role in the activation of NF-kB. A positive regulation between NOTCH and NF-kB signaling pathway has been described previously in macrophages isolated from patients with atherosclerosis. In those patients, and in contrast with our results,[2] 
evidence 2: Niclosamide and derivatives - potent inhibitors of TMEM16A/F and Ca2+ signaling. NFA is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory compound that inhibits goblet cell degranulation and suppresses asthma phenotype (4, 27). ...This result suggests an antiinflammatory effect of niclosamide, which corresponds well to inhibition of allergic lung inflammation by the TMEM16A inhibitor benzbromarone (3, 31).[3] 
evidence 3: The key findings of this study are that (a) Cl- fluxes mediated by the Ca2+-gated channel TMEM16A are a crucial determinant of pericyte tone; (b) TMEM16A is activated during ischemia and evokes a long-lasting pericytemediated capillary constriction that reduces CBF and favors neutrophil and platelet stalling; (c) genetic analysis suggests that increased TMEM16A expression is associated with poor recovery after ischemic stroke (and the genetic proxy[4] 
query: What is the therapeutic target for CADASIL? 
Summarize given evidences and query: TMEM16A is a therapeutic target for CADASIL[1]. Ischemia in CADASIL activates TMEM16A, Ca2+ gated Cl- channel, which regulates pericyte tone and induces capillary constriction[2]. Potent inhibitors of TMEM16A, niclosamide has antiinflammtory effect[3]. Niclosamide can suppress enhance inflammation in CADASIL[4].[5]. 

evidence 0: CADASIL) is sometimes misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis (MS). MS and CADASIL are not known to co-occur and brain magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) findings can help with differential diagnosis. Despite the availability of this information, a case report is presented of a 61-year-old woman who was misdiagnosed with MS at age 50, tested positive for CADASIL at age 56, described incorrectly as having both conditions simultaneously, and continued on MS disease-modifying medications, resulting in financial and physical hardship.[1]

Neuropsychological consultation helped initiate removal of the MS diagnosis and treatment. Better understanding is needed among clinicians that MS and CADASIL are not known to co-exist, that no association has been found between MS and the NOTCH3 mutations that cause CADASIL, and that neuroimaging and clinical features can help distinguish between the two conditions in addition to genetic testing.[2] 
evidence 2: Antithrombotic drugs were used in three patients, in one for an unrelated coexisting prothrombotic condition. CADASIL does not seem to be associated with an unfavorable outcome of pregnancy either for women and fetuses. Patients and treating physicians should be reassured that pregnancy can be safely initiated in CADASIL, as there is no evidence to support a specific preventive antithrombotic treatment during pregnancy in CADASIL.[3]

evidence 0: Using both wild type mice and transgenic mice carrying the human mutant Notch3 gene (CADASIL mice), we have recently characterized the pathological features of CADASIL and determined the therapeutic efficacy of two hematopoietic growth factors, stem cell factor (SCF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in CADASIL.

evidence 1: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most common condition of hereditary stroke and vascular dementia.

However, the pathogenesis of CADASIL remains largely unknown, and treatment that can stop or delay the progression of CADASIL is not yet available.[2] 
evidence 2: Today, CADASIL is known to every neurologist, but the disease has not yet revealed all its secrets. A lot of effort is still needed to understand the intimate mechanisms of the disease and the most efficient targets or approaches for the development of efficient therapeutics. The history of CADASIL will be further enriched by multiple ongoing research projects worldwide, at clinical and preclinical level, and will continue to enlighten research in the field of cerebral small vessel disorders.[3]

evidence 0: Here we report the characterization of the human Notch3 gene which we mapped to the CADASIL critical region. We have identified mutations in CADASIL patients that cause serious disruption of this gene, indicating that Notch3 could be the defective protein in CADASIL patients.All these missense mutations may result in severe disruption of the Notch3 protein, as suggested by the highly conserved nature of the aminoacid residues involved, particularly the cysteines that are key features of EGF-like domains. These results indicate that these nucleotide substitutions are pathogenic mutations rather than rare polymorphisms.[1]
